# GitHub Night Themes for Typora

Three dark themes for [Typora](https://typora.io), a multi-platform Markdown Editor, that reproduces the new GitHub Dark Themes, recently deployed on their website â€” Default Dark, Dark dimmed, Dark High Contrast.

## Installation

1. Download the zipped project package or the [latest stable release](https://github.com/kinoute/typora-github-night-theme/releases).
2. Launch Typora and open `Preferences` from the app menu.
3. Go to the `Appearance` tab, and choose `Open Theme Folder`.
4. Copy all the `github-night*.css` files and the `github-night` folder to your Typora theme library.
5. Launch or restart Typora and choose one of the `GitHub Night` themes from the theme menu.

## Status

The themes are usable on all three platforms. Since I have only macOS at my disposal right now to test, the themes might look weird on Windows/Linux and still need improvements.

For that matter, Issues and Pull Requests are very welcome!

## Screenshots

All the screenshots below feature the default GitHub Dark theme, "GitHub Night".
